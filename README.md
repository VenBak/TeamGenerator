# TeamGenerator

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a tool used to develop teams within the command line interface using Node.js and the node package manager (npm) in order to achieve that. 

The motivation behind this project was to further understand the intricacies of using node.js but also understanding how the back-end can be used to create and store objects. During the development of this project I learnt how to use classes and constructors in order to create objects. 

The problems that this project solves is having to manually create an html file for data which you already know how will be structured. Thus using this project makes this task much more efficient and taught me many fundamentals
